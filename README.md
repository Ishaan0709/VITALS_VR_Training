VITALS — AI-Assisted VR Surgical Training Platform

VITALS is a Unity-powered VR training platform designed to give medical students safe, repeatable, and hands-on practice for surgical procedures. Built for the Israel–India Hackathon (Hack4Help), VITALS puts immersive VR simulations at the center and pairs them with a companion web app and an AI Surgical Mentor for step-wise guidance, questions, and feedback.

📖 Description

Modern medical students face a huge challenge — theory-heavy learning with minimal hands-on surgical exposure. Cadaver training is limited, expensive, and often unavailable. Students enter hospitals underprepared, impacting confidence and patient safety.

VITALS bridges this gap by offering:

Unity-based VR simulator (core): immersive, step-wise surgical practice in a safe, repeatable environment.

AI Surgical Mentor: instant, specialist-informed answers and guidance alongside practice.

Structured WebApp: responsive interface for modules, checklists, and learning flows.

This ensures safe, repeatable, and cost-effective practice opportunities for students worldwide.

✨ Features

VR Simulation (Core) 🎮 — Unity 3D + WebGL with headset support (Meta Quest, HTC Vive, etc.) for immersive surgical training.

AI-powered Chatbot 🤖 — Specialist-informed Q&A and step-wise mentoring during practice.

Personalized Guidance 🧠 — Context-aware learning tailored to the student’s progress.

Full-stack Deployment 🚀 — Frontend on Vercel, Backend API on Render.

Responsive Design 📱💻 — Works seamlessly on mobile & desktop.

Future Haptics & Devices — Designed to plug in haptics and peripherals.
